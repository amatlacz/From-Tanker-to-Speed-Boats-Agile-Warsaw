FROM TANKER TO SPEED BOATS – A CASE STUDY FOR AGILE TRANSFORMATION IN BIG CORPORATIONS

Imagine you are a captain of a tanker ship. You are steering it through a rough sea. You feel the power going through your veins when waves crashe on sides of your ship… But what is that? A storm is coming? An iceberg is in front of you? Your first mate has fallen overboard? If you do nothing – things are going to get messy very soon…

Being in charge of a big corporation is like steering a tanker ship. It’s really hard to change the direction once you get forward. In a fast changing world, where you feel the breath of the competition on your neck and new startups are founded everyday – you have to be agile. You have to be lean. That is what makes Lean Startup approach so successful in the current market. But does it mean that corporations are doomed to failure…?

How to make a corporation more agile? How to measure the change? What are the major challenges in the transformations of big corporations? How to spark a fire for the change in the organization and assure that it will remain long enough to see the first results? These and many more will be discussed in a case study for agile transformations in big corporations.
